What are the benefits of using a Content Management System (CMS) for building and maintaining a website?

A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and publish digital content without the need for extensive technical skills. A CMS provides several benefits for web development such as ease of use, scalability, and flexibility. With a CMS, non-technical users can easily create, edit and update website content, which can save time and reduce the need for web developers. Additionally, a CMS can be easily scaled to accommodate growing website needs, such as increased traffic, and it can be easily integrated with other tools such as analytics, search engine optimization and social media.
